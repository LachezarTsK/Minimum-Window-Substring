File Solution archived.java was done some time ago, before I had advanced knowledge in JavaScript and C++.
Back then, I already had advanced knowledge in Java.


Files Solution.java, Solution.js and Solution.cpp were uploaded in October, 2022. 
In terms of time and space complexity, the archived solution and the new ones are the same. 
The new uploads, however, apply one instead of two frequency arrays.
